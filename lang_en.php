// PARCOURS
define("PROPOS","About me");
define("BLABLAPROPOS","I began my university education with a bachelor’s degree in Modern Literature. As I came from an economics and social sciences baccalaureate, I wanted to keep a certain openness and diversity in my education.
<br>This is why I decided to pursue a master’s degree in interculturality, world literatures and translation. I did my final year work placement at the publishing house Zulma in Paris, where I was in charge of updating and proofreading the website, as well as proofreading books to be published.
<br>Through this I acquired a versatile skill set, which has been invaluable in my professional endeavours ever since. I have also been volunteering for the website Elbakin.net since 2006, becoming secretary of the association in 2015. Through these responsibilities, I have gained new professional and personal skills: project management, public relations, web redaction, webmastering, etc.
<br>I have always been enthusiastic about the technical aspects of languages and translation and have decided to take my career in a new direction by pursuing a year-long training program with the CAWEB master’s degree in localisation and design of multilingual websites.");
